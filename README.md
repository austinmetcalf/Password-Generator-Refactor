# Password Generator

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a working password generator.  The project is intended to demonstrate efficient Javascript behind the generator and meet password criteria.  If criteria is not met, appropriate alerts are given to correct user.  Lines 37-39 of the Javascript code are borrowed from Stack overflow.  It was necessary to borrow that as the randomization of characters exceeded my own coding knowledge. 

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, Javascript.
